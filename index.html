  <h1>Dear Future Project Partner,</h1>
  <p>
    I hope you are reading this. If you enjoy building fun personal projects and dream of creating something people truly want, or if you're stuck with a problem in your head but scared of executing it alone,
    we should connect once to see whether we should work together or not.
  </p>

  <h2>What I am looking for in a project partner?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>‚úÖ Must be located in US, for cracking distribution and on ground sales</strong></li>
    <li><strong>‚úÖ Determination >>>>> Personality (Optimistic) >>> Take on any challenge >>> ...rest</strong></li>
    <li><strong>‚úÖ An excellent LISTENER, who prioritizes understanding the customer over just talking</strong></li>
    <li><strong>‚úÖ Should be more of a seller than a builder</strong></li>
    <li><strong>‚úÖ Should have the ability to think with an outcome-oriented mindset, focusing on value creation for customers rather than just adding features</strong></li>
    <li><strong>‚úÖ Someone who absolutely agrees on "Perfection is the enemy of Progress"</strong></li>
    <li><strong>‚úÖ Not afraid to ship imperfect or "ugly" MVP to get things moving</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Note:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>‚ùå If you love talking about ideas and changing the world but aren't willing to take action</strong></li>
    <li><strong>‚ùå If you can't say NO to other great ideas while focusing on what we're already working on, we're not the right fit to work together</strong></li>
  </ul>
