  <h1>Dear Future Project Partner,</h1>
  <p>
    I hope you are reading this. If you enjoy building fun personal projects and dream of creating something people truly want,
    we should connect once to see whether we should work together or not.
  </p>

  <h2>Partnership Philosophy</h2>

  <pre><code>function weArePartners() {
  if (weEnjoyWorkingTogether) {
    if (isOurLastProjectFailed()) {
      startExploringNewProjects(); // Move on to new ideas
    } else {
      continueWorking(); // Keep working on the current project
    }
  } else {
    console.log("we say goodbye to eachother respectfully");
    exit(1);
  }

  if (weLikeTheProjectIdea) {
    keepPushingForward(); // Stay on course
  } else {
    reassessProjectFit(); // Rethink the project fit
  }
}

function isOurLastProjectFailed() {
  if (isDeterminationLost === true) {
    console.log("Lost determination means we seperate. say goodbye. we go our own path. be friends.");
    exit(1);
  } else {
    console.log("The last project was a failure. We eat ice cream and move on quickly to something new!");
    return false; // If determination is intact, we keep going.
  }
}

function startExploringNewProjects() {
  console.log("Let's start brainstorming new ideas and solving new problems!");
}</code></pre>

  <h2>What I am looking for in a project partner?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>✅ Must be located in US, for cracking distribution and on ground sales</strong></li>
    <li><strong>✅ Determination >>>>> Personality (Optimistic) >>> Take on any challenge >>> ...rest</strong></li>
    <li><strong>✅ An excellent LISTENER, who prioritizes understanding the customer over just talking</strong></li>
    <li><strong>✅ Should be more of a seller than a builder</strong></li>
    <li><strong>✅ Should have the ability to think with an outcome-oriented mindset, focusing on value creation for customers rather than just adding features</strong></li>
    <li><strong>✅ Someone who absolutely agrees on "Perfection is the enemy of Progress"</strong></li>
    <li><strong>✅ Not afraid to ship imperfect or "ugly" MVP to get things moving</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Note:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>❌ If you love talking about ideas and changing the world but aren't willing to take action</strong></li>
    <li><strong>❌ If you can't say NO to other great ideas while focusing on what we're already working on, we're not the right fit to work together</strong></li>
  </ul>
